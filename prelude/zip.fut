-- | Transforming arrays of tuples into tuples of arrays and back
-- again.
--
-- These are generally very cheap operations, as the internal compiler
-- representation is always tuples of arrays.

-- The main reason this module exists is that we need it to define
-- SOACs like `map2`.

-- We need a map to define some of the zip variants, but this file is
-- depended upon by soacs.fut.  So we just define a quick-and-dirty
-- internal one here that uses the intrinsic version.
