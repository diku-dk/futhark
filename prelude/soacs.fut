-- | Various Second-Order Array Combinators that are operationally
-- parallel in a way that can be exploited by the compiler.
--
-- The functions here are all recognised specially by the compiler (or
-- built on those that are).  The asymptotic [work and
-- span](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_parallel_algorithms)
-- is provided for each function, but note that this easily hides very
-- substantial constant factors.  For example, `scan`@term is *much*
-- slower than `reduce`@term, although they have the same asymptotic
-- complexity.
--
-- **Higher-order complexity**
--
-- Specifying the time complexity of higher-order functions is tricky
-- because it depends on the functional argument.  We use the informal
-- convention that *W(f)* denotes the largest (asymptotic) *work* of
-- function *f*, for the values it may be applied to.  Similarly,
-- *S(f)* denotes the largest span.  See [this Wikipedia
-- article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_parallel_algorithms)
-- for a general introduction to these constructs.
--
-- **Reminder on terminology**
--
-- A function `op` is said to be *associative* if
--
--     (x `op` y) `op` z == x `op` (y `op` z)
--
-- for all `x`, `y`, `z`.  Similarly, it is *commutative* if
--
--     x `op` y == y `op` x
--
-- The value `o` is a *neutral element* if
--
--     x `op` o == o `op` x == x
--
-- for any `x`.

-- Implementation note: many of these definitions contain dynamically
-- checked size casts.  These will be removed by the compiler, but are
-- necessary for the type checker, as the 'intrinsics' functions are
-- not size-dependently typed.

-- | Reduce the array `as` with `op`, with `ne` as the neutral
-- element for `op`.  The function `op` must be associative.  If
-- it is not, the return value is unspecified.  If the value returned

-- the neutral element, and that must again have the same size as the
-- elements of the input array.

-- | `reduce_stream op f as` splits `as` into chunks, applies `f` to each

-- among as many threads as necessary to saturate the machine, with
-- each thread operating sequentially.

-- | `scatter as is vs` calculates the equivalent of this imperative
-- code:

-- ```
-- for j in 0...length is-1:
--   i = is[j]
--   v = vs[j]
--   if i >= 0 && i < length as:
--     as[i] = v
-- ```
--
-- The `is` and `vs` arrays must have the same outer size.  `scatter`
-- acts in-place and consumes the `as` array, returning a new array
-- that has the same type and elements as `as`, except for the indices
-- in `is`. Notice that writing outside the index domain of the target
-- array has no effect. If `is` contains duplicates for valid indexes
-- into the target array (i.e., several writes are performed to the
-- same location), the result is unspecified.  It is not guaranteed
-- that one of the duplicate writes will complete atomically - they
-- may be interleaved.  See `reduce_by_index`@term for a function that
-- can handle this case deterministically.

-- here because it is closely related to the SOACs.
