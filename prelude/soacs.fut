-- | Various Second-Order Array Combinators that are operationally
-- parallel in a way that can be exploited by the compiler.
--
-- The functions here are recognised specially by the compiler (or
-- built on those that are).  The asymptotic [work and
-- span](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_parallel_algorithms)
-- is provided for each function, but note that this easily hides very
-- substantial constant factors.  For example, `scan`@term is *much*
-- slower than `reduce`@term, although they have the same asymptotic
-- complexity.
--
-- **Higher-order complexity**
--
-- Specifying the time complexity of higher-order functions is tricky
-- because it depends on the functional argument.  We use the informal
-- convention that *W(f)* denotes the largest (asymptotic) *work* of
-- function *f*, for the values it may be applied to.  Similarly,
-- *S(f)* denotes the largest span.  See [this Wikipedia
-- article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_parallel_algorithms)
-- for a general introduction to these constructs.
--
-- **Reminder on terminology**
--
-- A function `op` is said to be *associative* if
--
--     (x `op` y) `op` z == x `op` (y `op` z)
--
-- for all `x`, `y`, `z`.  Similarly, it is *commutative* if
--
--     x `op` y == y `op` x
--
-- The value `o` is a *neutral element* if
--
--     x `op` o == o `op` x == x
--
-- for any `x`.

-- Implementation note: many of these definitions contain dynamically
-- checked size casts.  These will be removed by the compiler, but are
-- necessary for the type checker, as the 'intrinsics' functions are
-- not size-dependently typed.

-- | Reduce the array `as` with `op`, with `ne` as the neutral
-- element for `op`.  The function `op` must be associative.  If
-- it is not, the return value is unspecified.  If the value returned
-- by the operator is an array, it must have the exact same size as
-- the neutral element, and that must again have the same size as the
-- elements of the input array.

-- | As `reduce`, but the operator must also be commutative.  This is

-- | `h = hist op ne k is as` computes a generalised `k`-bin histogram
-- `h`, such that `h[i]` is the sum of those values `as[j]` for which
-- `is[j]==i`.  The summation is done with `op`, which must be a
-- commutative and associative function with neutral element `ne`.  If
-- a bin has no elements, its value will be `ne`.

-- | `r = spread k x is vs` produces an array `r` such that `r[i] =
