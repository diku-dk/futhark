-- | Definitions related to automatic differentiation.
--
-- Futhark supports a fairly complete facility for computing
-- derivatives of functions through automatic differentiation (AD).
-- The following does not constitute a full introduction to AD, which
-- is a substantial topic by itself, but rather introduces enough
-- concepts to describe Futhark's functional AD interface. AD is a
-- program transformation that is implemented in the compiler itself,
-- but the user interface is a handful of fairly simple functions.
--
-- AD is useful when optimising cost functions, and for any other
-- purpose where you might need derivatives, such as for example
-- computing surface normals for signed distance functions.
--
-- ## Jacobians
--
-- For a differentiable function *f* whose input comprise *n* scalars
-- and whose output comprises *m* scalars, the
-- [Jacobian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant)
-- for a given input point is an *m* by *n* matrix of scalars that
-- each represent a [partial
-- derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative).
-- Intuitively, position *(i,j)* of the Jacobian describes how
-- sensitive output *i* is to input *j*. The notion of Jacobian
-- generalises to functions that accept or produce compound structures
-- such as arrays, records, sums, and so on, simply by "flattening
-- out" the values and considering only their constituent scalars.
--
-- Computing the full Jacobian is usually costly and sometimes not
-- necessary, and it is not part of the AD facility provided by
-- Futhark. Instead it is possible to parts of the Jacobian.
--
-- We can take the product of an an *m* by *n* Jacobian with an
-- *n*-element *tangent vector* to produce an *m*-element vector
-- (*Jacobian-vector product*). Such a product can be computed in a
-- single (augmented) execution of the function *f*, and by choosing
-- the tangent vector appropriately we can use this to compute the
-- full Jacobian. This is provided by the function `jvp`.
--
-- We can also take the product of an *m*-element vector *cotangent
-- vector* with the *m* by *n* Jacobian to produce an *n*-element
-- vector (*Vector-Jacobian product*). This too can be computed in a
-- single execution of *f*, with `vjp`.
--
-- We can use the `jvp` function to produce a *column* of the full
-- Jacobian, and `vjp` to produce a *row*. Which is superior for a
-- given situation depends on whether the function has more inputs or
-- outputs.
--
-- You can freely nest `vjp` and `jvp` to compute higher-order
-- derivatives.
--
-- ## Efficiency
--
-- Both `jvp` and `vjp` work by transforming the program to carry
-- along extra information associated with each scalar value.
--
-- In the case of `vjp`, this extra information takes the form of an
-- additional scalar representing the tangent, which is then
-- propagated in each scalar computation using essentially the [chain
-- rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule). Therefore, `jvp`
-- has a memory overhead of approximately *2x*, and a computational
-- overhead of slightly more, but usually less than *4x*.
--
-- In the case of `jvp`, since our starting point is a *cotangent*,
-- the function is essentially first run forward, then backwards (the
-- *return sweep*) to propagate the cotangent. During the return
-- sweep, all intermediate results computed during the forward sweep
-- must still be available, and must therefore be stored in memory
-- during the forward sweep. This means that the memory usage of `jvp`
-- is essentially proportional to the number of sequential steps of
-- the original function (essentially turning *time* into *space*).
-- The compiler does a nontrivial amount of optimisation to ameliorate
-- this overhead (see [AD for an Array Language with Nested
-- Parallelism](https://futhark-lang.org/publications/sc22-ad.pdf)),
-- but it can still be substantial for programs with deep sequential
-- loops.
--
-- ## Differentiable functions
--
-- AD only gives meaningful results for differentiable functions. The
-- Futhark type system does not distinguish differentiable or
-- non-differentiable operations. As a rule of thumb, a function is
-- differentiable if its results are computed using a composition of
-- primitive floating-point operations, without ever converting to or
-- from integers.
--
-- ## Limitations
--
-- `jvp` is expected to work in all cases. `vjp` has limitations when
-- using the GPU backends similar to those for irregular flattening.
-- Specifically, you should avoid structures with variant sizes, such
-- as loops that carry an array that changes size through the
-- execution of the loop.
