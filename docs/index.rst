Futhark User's Guide
====================

Welcome to the documentation for the Futhark compiler and language.
For a basic introduction, please see `our website
<http://futhark-lang.org>`_.  To get started, read the page on
:ref:`installation`.  Once the compiler has been installed, you might
want to take a look at :ref:`language-overview` or
:ref:`c-porting-guide`.  Additional documentation can also be found in
our `publications`_.
