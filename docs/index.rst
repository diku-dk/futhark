Futhark User's Guide
====================

Welcome to the documentation for the Futhark compiler and language.
For a basic introduction, please see `the Futhark website
<http://futhark-lang.org>`_.  To get started, read the page on
:ref:`installation`.  Once the compiler has been installed, you might
want to take a look at :ref:`usage`.  This User's Guide contains a
:ref:`language-reference`, but new Futhark programmers are probably
better served by reading `Parallel Programming in Futhark
<https://futhark-book.readthedocs.io>`_ first.

Documentation for the built-in prelude is also `available online
<https://futhark-lang.org/docs/prelude/>`_.

The particularly interested reader may also want to peruse the
`publications <https://futhark-lang.org/docs.html#publications>`_, or
the `development blog <https://futhark-lang.org/blog.html>`_.
