Hacking on the Futhark Compiler
===============================

The Futhark compiler is a significant body of code with a not entirely
straightforward design.  The main reference is the `documentation of
the compiler internals`_ that is automatically generated by Haddock.
If you feel that it is incomplete, or lacks an explanation, then feel
free to report it is an an issue on the `Github page`_.  Documentation
bugs are bugs too.

The Futhark compiler is built using `Stack`_.  It's a good idea to
familiarise yourself with how it works.  As a starting point, here are
a few hints:

  * To test with different GHC versions, point the ``STACK_YAML``
    environment variable at another file.  For example, to build using
    the Stack LTS 1.15 snapshot (GHC 7.8), we would run::

      $ STACK_YAML=stack-lts-1.15.yaml stack build

  * When testing, pass ``--fast`` to ``stack`` to disable the GHC
    optimiser.  This speeds up builds considerably (although it still
    takes a while).  The resulting Futhark compiler will run slower,
    but it is not something you will notice for small test programs.

  * When debugging, pass ``--profile`` to ``stack``.  This will build
    the Futhark compiler with debugging information (not just
    profiling).  In particular, hard crashes will print a stack trace.
    You can also get actual profiling information by passing
    ``+RTS -pprof-all -RTS`` to the Futhark compiler.  This asks the
    Haskell runtime to print profiling information to a file.  For
    more information, see the `Profiling`_ chapter in the GHC User
    Guide.

  * You may with to set the environment variable
    ``FUTHARK_COMPILER_DEBUGGING=1``.  Currently this only has the
    effect of making the frontend print internal names, but it may
    control more things in the future.

Debugging Internal Type Errors
------------------------------

The Futhark compiler uses a typed core language, and the type checker
is run after every pass.  If a given pass produces a program with
inconsistent typing, the compiler will report an error and abort.
While not every compiler bug will manifest itself as a core language
type error (unfortunately), many will.  To write the erroneous core
program to a file in case of type error, pass ``-v filename`` to the
compiler.  This will also enable verbose output, so you can tell which
pass fails.  The ``-v`` option is also useful when the compiler itself
crashes, as you can at least tell where in the pipeline it got to.

Checking Generated Code
-----------------------

Hacking on the compiler will often involve inspecting the quality of
the generated code.  The recommended way to do this is to use
:ref:`futhark-c(1)` or :ref:`futhark-opencl(1)` to compile a Futhark
program to an executable.  These backends insert various forms of
instrumentation that can be enabled by passing run-time options to the
generated executable.

  * As a first resort, use ``-t`` option to use the built-in runtime
    measurements.  A nice trick is to pass ``-t /dev/stderr``, while
    redirecting standard output to ``/dev/null``.  This will print the
    runtime on the screen, but not the execution result.

  * Optionally use ``-r`` to ask for several runs, e.g. ``-r 10``.  If
    combined with ``-t``, this will cause several runtimes to be
    printed (one per line).  The :ref:`futhark-bench(1)` tool itself
    uses ``-t`` and ``-r`` to perform its measurements.

  * Pass ``-D`` to have the program print information on allocation
    and deallocation of memory.

  * (:ref:`futhark-opencl(1)` only) Use the ``-D`` option to enable
    synchronous execution.  ``clFinish()`` will be called after most
    OpenCL operations, and a running log of kernel invocations will be
    printed.  At the end of execution, the program prints a table
    summarising all kernels and their total runtime and average
    runtime.

Using the ``futhark`` Tool
--------------------------

For debugging specific compiler passes, there is a tool simply called
:ref:`futhark(1)`, which allows you to tailor your own compilation
pipeline using command line options.  It is also useful for seeing
what the AST looks like after specific passes.
