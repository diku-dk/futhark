SYNOPSIS
========

futhark multicore [options...] <program.fut>

DESCRIPTION
===========

``futhark multicore`` translates a Futhark program to multithreaded C
code, and either compiles that C code with a C compiler to an
executable binary program, or produces a ``.h`` and ``.c`` file that
can be linked with other code.  The standard Futhark optimisation
pipeline is used.

The resulting program will read the arguments to the entry point
(``main`` by default) from standard input and print its return value
on standard output.  The arguments are read and printed in Futhark
syntax.

OPTIONS
=======

Accepts the same options as :ref:`futhark-c(1)`.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
=====================

``CC``

  The C compiler used to compile the program.  Defaults to ``cc`` if
  unset.

``CFLAGS``

  Space-separated list of options passed to the C compiler.  Defaults
  to ``-O3 -std=c99 -pthread`` if unset.

EXECUTABLE OPTIONS
==================

Generated executables accept the same options as those generated by
:ref:`futhark-c(1)`.  The following additional options are accepted.

-P, --profile

  Collect and report various bits of profiling information.

--num-threads=INT

  Use this many physical threads.

BUGS
====

Currently works only on Unix-like systems because of a dependency on
pthreads.  Adding support for Windows would likely not be difficult.
