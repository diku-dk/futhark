SYNOPSIS
========

futhark hip [options...] <program.fut>

DESCRIPTION
===========


``futhark hip`` translates a Futhark program to C code invoking HIP
kernels, and either compiles that C code with a C compiler to an
executable binary program, or produces a ``.h`` and ``.c`` file that
can be linked with other code. The standard Futhark optimisation
pipeline is used.

``futhark hip`` uses ``-lhiprtc -lamdhip64`` to link.  If using
``--library``, you will need to do the same when linking the final
binary.  Although the HIP backend can be made to work on NVIDIA GPUs,
you are probably better off using the very similar
:ref:`futhark-cuda(1)`.

OPTIONS
=======

Accepts the same options as :ref:`futhark-c(1)`.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
=====================

``CC``

  The C compiler used to compile the program.  Defaults to ``cc`` if
  unset.

``CFLAGS``

  Space-separated list of options passed to the C compiler.  Defaults
  to ``-O -std=c99`` if unset.

EXECUTABLE OPTIONS
==================

Generated executables accept the same options as those generated by
:ref:`futhark-c(1)`.  For commonality, the options use OpenCL
nomenclature ("group" instead of "thread block").

The following additional options are accepted.

-h, --help

  Print help text to standard output and exit.

--default-group-size=INT

  The default size of thread blocks that are launched.  Capped to the
  hardware limit if necessary.

--default-num-groups=INT

  The default number of thread blocks that are launched.

--default-threshold=INT

  The default parallelism threshold used for comparisons when
  selecting between code versions generated by incremental flattening.
  Intuitively, the amount of parallelism needed to saturate the GPU.

--default-tile-size=INT

  The default tile size used when performing two-dimensional tiling
  (the workgroup size will be the square of the tile size).

--dump-hip=FILE

  Don't run the program, but instead dump the embedded HIP kernels to
  the indicated file.  Useful if you want to see what is actually
  being executed.

--load-hip=FILE

  Instead of using the embedded HIP kernels, load them from the
  indicated file.

-n, --no-print-result

  Do not print the program result.

--build-option=OPT

  Add an additional build option to the string passed to the kernel
  compiler (HIPRTC).  Refer to the HIP documentation for which options
  are supported.  Be careful - some options can easily result in
  invalid results.

--param=ASSIGNMENT

  Set a tuning parameter to the given
  value. ``ASSIGNMENT`` must be of the form ``NAME=INT`` Use
  ``--print-params`` to see which names are available.

--print-params

  Print all tuning parameters that can be set with ``--param`` or
  ``--tuning``.

--tuning=FILE

  Read size=value assignments from the given file.

ENVIRONMENT
===========

If run without ``--library``, ``futhark hip`` will invoke a C
compiler to compile the generated C program into a binary.  This only
works if the C compiler can find the necessary HIP libraries.
