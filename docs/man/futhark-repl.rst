SYNOPSIS
========

futhark repl [program.fut]

DESCRIPTION
===========

Start an interactive Futhark session.  This will let you interactively
enter expressions and declarations which are then immediately
interpreted.  If the entered line can be either a declaration or an
expression, it is assumed to be a declaration.

Futhark source files can be loaded using the ``:load`` command.  This
will erase any interactively entered definitions.  Use the ``:help``
command to see a list of commands.  All commands are prefixed with a
colon.

``futhark repl`` uses the Futhark interpreter, which grants access to
the ``#[trace]`` and ``#[break]`` attributes.  See
:ref:`futhark-run(1)` for a description.
