Rosetta Code Implementations
============================

This directory contains Futhark implementations of tasks from [Rosetta
Code](http://rosettacode.org).  We try to keep this Git repository and
the [list of
implementations](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Futhark) in
synch, but this is a manual process.

Not all of these implementations are particularly good.  Furthermore,
there are many problems that Futhark is not able to solve well or at
all, e.g. anything involving IO or most things about string
processing.  The latter is possible, but painful and not really in our
domain.
