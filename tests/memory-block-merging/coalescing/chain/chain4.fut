-- A more complex example.

-- This is an example where too aggressive allocation hoisting is a bad thing.
-- If implemented without the current limiter, this would happen: To enable an
-- eventual coalescing into vss, both the allocation for the memory of vss,
-- *and* the vss array creation statement itself, are hoisted upwards as much as
-- possible.  This hinders the later coalescing into wsss, and was never useful
-- to begin with, since there can be no coalescing into vss regardless.
--
-- To fix this in a nicer way, we could perform allocation hoisting while we do
-- coalescing instead of before we do it, which would help at least for this
-- program.  Maybe?

  -- succeeds (and to otherwise succeed), we have to create wsss between xs and
  -- vss, in which case vss will be created (and thus used) after xs, which
