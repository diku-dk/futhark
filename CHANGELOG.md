# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0]

### Added

   * A comprehensible error message is now issued when attempting to
     run a Futhark program on an OpenCL that does not support the
     types used by the program.  A common case was trying to use
     double-precision floats on an Intel GPU.

   * Parallelism inside of a branch can now be exploited if the branch
     condition and the size of its results is invariant to all
     enclosing parallel loops.

### Removed

### Changed

  * futlib: the `complex` module now produces a non-abstract `complex`
    type.

  * futlib: the `random` module has been overhauled, with several new
    engines and adaptors changed, and some of the module types
    changed.  In particular, `rng_distribution` now contains a numeric
    module instead of an abstract type.

  * Type errors involving abstract types from modules now use
    qualified names (less "expected 't', got 't'", more "expected
    'foo.t', got 'bar.t'").

### Fixed

  * Fusion would sometimes remove safety checks on e.g. `reshape`
    (#436).

  * Variables used as implicit fields in a record construction are now
    properly recognised as being used.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

  * Run-time errors due to failed assertions now include a stack
    trace.

  * Generated OpenCL code now picks more sensible group size and count
    when running on a CPU.

  * `scatter` expressions nested in `map`s may now be parallelised
    ("segmented scatter").

  * Add `num_bits`/`get_bit`/`set_bit` functions to numeric module
    types, including a new `float` module type.

  * Size annotations may now refer to preceding parameters, e.g:

        let f (n: i32) (xs: [n]i32) = ...

  * `futhark-doc`: retain parameter names in generated docs.

  * `futhark-doc`: now takes `-v`/`--verbose` options.

  * `futhark-doc`: now generates valid HTML.

  * `futhark-doc`: now permits files to contain a leading documentation
    comment.

  * `futhark-py`/`futhark-pyopencl`: Better dynamic type checking in
    entry points.

  * Primitive functions (sqrt etc) can now be constant-folded.

  * Futlib: /futlib/vec2 added.

### Removed

  * The built-in `shape` function has been removed.  Use `length` or
    size parameters.

### Changed

  * The `from_i32`/`from_i64` functions of the `numeric` module type
    have been replaced with functions named `i32`/`i64`.  Similarly
    functions have been added for all the other primitive types
    (factored into a new `from_prim` module type).

  * The overloaded type conversion functions (`i32`, `f32`, `bool`,
    etc) have been removed.  Four functions have been introduced for
    the special cases of converting between `f32`/`f64` and `i32`:
    `r32`, `r64`, `t32`, `t64`.

  * Modules and variables now inhabit the same name space.  As a
    consequence, we now use `x.y` to access field `y` of record `x`.

  * Record expression syntax has been simplified.  Record
    concatenation and update is no longer directly supported.
    However, fields can now be implicitly defined: `{x,y}` now creates
    a record with field `x` and `y`, with values taken from the
    variables `x` and `y` in scope.

### Fixed

  * The `!=` operator now works properly on arrays (#426).

  * Allocations were sometimes hoisted incorrectly (#419).

  * `f32.e` is no longer pi.

  * Various other fixes.

## [0.1.0]

  (This is just a list of highlights of what was included in the first
   release.)

  * Code generators: Python and C, both with OpenCL.

  * Higher-order ML-style module system.

  * In-place updates.

  * Tooling: futhark-test, futhark-bench, futhark-dataset, futhark-doc.

  * Beginnings of a basis library, "futlib".
