== Futhark Examples

This directory contains Futhark implementations of various simple
algorithms.  Each program is self-contained and written with clarity
in mind.  Some may use the standard library.

These examples are still part of the test suite, so they contain
input/output pairs.  When adding new examples, try to avoid making
data sets that take too long to run.  We have the [benchmark
suite](https://github.com/HIPERFIT/futhark-benchmarks) for that.
