Futhark is a purely functional data-parallel programming language in
the ML family.  It can be compiled to typically very efficient
parallel code, running on either a CPU or GPU.  The language is
developed at [DIKU](http://diku.dk) at the University of Copenhagen,
originally as part of the [HIPERFIT centre](http://hiperfit.dk).  It
is quite stable and suitable for practical programming.
