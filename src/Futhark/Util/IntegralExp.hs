-- | It is occasionally useful to define generic functions that can
-- not only compute their result as an integer, but also as a symbolic
-- expression in the form of an AST.
--
-- There are some Haskell hacks for this - it is for example not hard
-- to define an instance of 'Num' that constructs an AST.  However,
-- this falls down for some other interesting classes, like
-- 'Integral', which requires both the problematic method
-- 'fromInteger', and also that the type is an instance of 'Enum'.
--
-- We can always just define hobbled instances that call 'error' for
-- those methods that are impractical, but this is ugly.
--
-- Hence, this module defines similes to standard Haskell numeric
-- typeclasses that have been modified to make generic functions
-- slightly easier to write.
