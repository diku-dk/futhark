-- Perform general rule-based simplification based on data dependency
-- information.  This module will:
--
--    * Perform common-subexpression elimination (CSE).
--
--    * Hoist expressions out of loops (including lambdas) and
--    branches.  This is done as aggressively as possible.
--
--    * Apply simplification rules (see
--    "Futhark.Optimise.Simplification.Rules").
--
-- If you just want to run the simplifier as simply as possible, you
-- may prefer to use the "Futhark.Optimise.Simplify" module.
