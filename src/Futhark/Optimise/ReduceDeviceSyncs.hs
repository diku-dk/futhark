-- | This module implements an optimization that migrates host
-- statements into 'GPUBody' kernels to reduce the number of
-- host-device synchronizations that occur when a scalar variable is
-- written to or read from device memory. Which statements that should
-- be migrated are determined by a 'MigrationTable' produced by the
-- "Futhark.Optimise.ReduceDeviceSyncs.MigrationTable" module; this module
-- merely performs the migration and rewriting dictated by that table.
