-- | This module contains the type definitions and basic operations
-- for the graph that
-- "Futhark.Optimise.ReduceDeviceSyncs.MigrationTable" internally uses
-- to construct a migration table.  It is however completely
-- Futhark-agnostic and implements a generic graph abstraction.
--
-- = Overview
--
-- The 'Graph' type is a data flow dependency graph of program variables, each
-- variable represented by a 'Vertex'. A vertex may have edges to other vertices
-- or to a sink, which is a special vertex with no graph representation. Each
-- edge to a vertex is either from another vertex or from a source, which also
-- is a special vertex with no graph representation.
--
-- The primary graph operation provided by this module is 'route'. Given the
-- vertex that some unspecified source has an edge to, a path is attempted
-- found to a sink. If a sink can be reached from the source, all edges along
-- the path are reversed. The path in the opposite direction of reversed edges
-- from a source to some sink is a route.
--
-- Routes can be used to find a minimum vertex cut in the graph through what
-- amounts to a specialized depth-first search implementation of the
-- Ford-Fulkerson method. When viewed in this way each graph edge has a capacity
-- of 1 and the reversing of edges to create routes amounts to sending reverse
-- flow through a residual network (the current state of the graph).
-- The max-flow min-cut theorem allows one to determine a minimum edge cut that
-- separates the sources and sinks.
--
-- If each vertex @v@ in the graph is viewed as two vertices, @v_in@ and
-- @v_out@, with all ingoing edges to @v@ going to @v_in@, all outgoing edges
-- from @v@ going from @v_out@, and @v_in@ connected to @v_out@ with a single
-- edge, then the minimum edge cut of the view amounts to a minimum vertex cut
-- in the actual graph. The view need not be manifested as whether @v_in@ or
-- @v_out@ is reached by an edge to @v@ can be determined from whether that edge
-- is reversed or not. The presence of an outgoing, reversed edge also gives the
-- state of the virtual edge that connects @v_in@ to @v_out@.
--
-- When routing fails to find a sink in some subgraph reached via an edge then
-- that edge is marked exhausted. No sink can be reached via an exhausted edge,
-- and any subsequent routing attempt will skip pathfinding along such edge.
