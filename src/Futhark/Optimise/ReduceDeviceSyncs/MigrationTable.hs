-- This module implements program analysis to determine which program statements
-- the "Futhark.Optimise.ReduceDeviceSyncs" pass should move into 'GPUBody' kernels
-- to reduce blocking memory transfers between host and device. The results of
-- the analysis is encoded into a 'MigrationTable' which can be queried.
--
-- To reduce blocking scalar reads the module constructs a data flow
-- dependency graph of program variables (see
-- "Futhark.Optimise.ReduceDeviceSyncs.MigrationTable.Graph") in which
-- it finds a minimum vertex cut that separates array reads of scalars
-- from transitive usage that cannot or should not be migrated to
-- device.
--
-- The variables of each partition are assigned a 'MigrationStatus' that states
-- whether the computation of those variables should be moved to device or
-- remain on host. Due to how the graph is built and the vertex cut is found all
-- variables bound by a single statement will belong to the same partition.
--
-- The vertex cut contains all variables that will reside in device memory but
-- are required by host operations. These variables must be read from device
-- memory and cannot be reduced further in number merely by migrating
-- statements (subject to the accuracy of the graph model). The model is built
-- to reduce the worst-case number of scalar reads; an optimal migration of
-- statements depends on runtime data.
--
-- Blocking scalar writes are reduced by either turning such writes into
-- asynchronous kernels, as is done with scalar array literals and accumulator
-- updates, or by transforming host-device writing into device-device copying.
--
-- For details on how the graph is constructed and how the vertex cut is found,
-- see the master thesis "Reducing Synchronous GPU Memory Transfers" by Philip
-- BÃ¸rgesen (2022).

      --
      -- Since this cost is difficult to quantify and amortize over assertion
      -- migration candidates (cost depends on ordering of kernels and reads) we
      -- assume it is insignificant. This will likely hold for a system where
      -- multiple threads or processes schedules GPU work, as system-wide

      -- Under the CUDA backend every read is synchronous and is followed by
