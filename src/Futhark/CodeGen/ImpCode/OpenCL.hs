-- | Imperative code with an OpenCL component.

-- Apart from ordinary imperative code, this also carries around an
-- OpenCL program as a string, as well as a list of kernels defined by
-- the OpenCL program.
--
-- The imperative code has been augmented with a 'LaunchKernel'
-- operation that allows one to execute an OpenCL kernel.
