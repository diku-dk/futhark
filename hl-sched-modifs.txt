The intent is to provide a list of changes w.r.t. master.
If I forget something, in principle, changes have comments 
that include the word "cosmin", so you can grep for them.

1. In `src/Futhark/IR/SOACS/Simplify.hs` -> 

   (a) Have disabled rule `RuleOp simplifyMapIota` from `topDownRules`
   (b) have disabled hoisting out of parallel constructs in 
         `simplifySOACS`, `simplifyFun` and `simplifyLambda` using
         the newly defined `dont_hoist_from_par`

2. In `Futhark.Optimise.Simplify.Engine` ->
    -  added `alwaysBlocks` to the list of exports

3. In `src/Futhark/Optimise/InliningDeadFun.hs` ->
   Added treatment for special functions, such as
     `pad1D`, `strip1`, `strip2`, `hlSched2D`, `fuseSched2D`.
   These are included in global variable `do_not_inline` and
     prevented from being inlined, so we can find them and use
     their intended semantics.

4. In `Futhark.Optimise.Fusion.GraphRep`
   Added and exported function `isHLschedNodeT`, which identifies schedules
   and various other modifications.
   
5. In `Futhark.Optimise.Fusion`
   - modified `relevant` nodes for vertical fusion in `doVerticalFusion`
   - function `tryFuseNodeInGraph` is the entry point for applying HL-Schedules,
       i.e., calls `HLS.applyHLsched`

6. High-Level Schedules are implemented starting with new source file
     `Futhark.Optimise.Fusion.HLsched`, which exports `applyHLsched`
